# Meridional-Circulation-Dedalus2
Code to solve a 1D inhomogeneous diffusion equation using a spectral framework called Dedalus2 (Burns et. al. 2020). 
This code is specifically tailored to studying the penetration of meridional circulation in stellar radiative zones but can but used to study other systems as well.

Edit: Added code to solve 2D meridional circulation using primitive equations from Showman et. al. 2006 including mean molecular weight gradients.
